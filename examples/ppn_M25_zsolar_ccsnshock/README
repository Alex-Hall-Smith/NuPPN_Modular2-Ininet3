There are different trajectories available for processing in the directory 
cases. Please select one in the top section of the run_me.sh script. 

Then make the ppn executable with make command and execute the run_me.sh
script. 

clean_output	clean directory for a fresh run, all relevant files from 
	  	any previous run will be deleted
run_me.sh	use this to launch a new run, select the trajectory type
		in the header section of this script

This trajectory is from a 25 Msun model by Fryer et al (2017) using a KEPLER
progenitor model by Alex Heger created for the NuGrid collaboration circa 2015.
The explosion model name is run25f1_280M1.83ril. The initial abundances were
from post-processing MPPNP calculations by Samuel Jones using the modular2
branch of MPPNP, and are currently (2018) being prepared for submission to
MNRAS in a paper about Fe60.
The trajectory is for particle 1090, which was selected due to it having the
largest production of fe60 in the shocked He shell.

input files:
------------

* Note that the ppn_physics_st.input and ppn_physics_dcy.input files are used
  at run time for the standard and decay runs, so the user must modify these 
  instead of ppn_physics.input
