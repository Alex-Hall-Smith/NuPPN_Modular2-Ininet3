! please go to the bottom of this file to learn how the namelists work

! for detailed documentaion see ../DOC/mppnp-chapter.pdf and of course the code

&ppn_frame

    	iolevel = 1     ! how much output do you want, >4 is for debugging

        sig_term_limit = 1d+10  ! upper limit for diffusion coefficients similar to that in MESA

        hif = 1   ! HIF modification on: 1, off: 0

! Some other parameters concernng grid refinement:

        msl = 5000   ! maximum number of spatial zones
        nrefmax = 23 ! refinement level
        gfdim = 20   ! max num of refinement species
