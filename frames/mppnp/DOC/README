mppnp.tex       contains the chapter include file. Rename this according to
                what you are documenting
mppnp-chapter.tex  the wrapper that allows you to compile the chapter include
                   file locally into this directory.

The nugrid.sty is slightly different here compared to the one in the
top level docs directory. If you have references get the ngastro bib
file from the docs directory and commit back to there.

Use 'runlatex' to compile. The chapter header has a different form if
compiled into the book in docs or into the standalone mppnp-chapter
wrapper here:

% \chapter{\ndoctitle}   % uncomment this if compiled into book in docs directory
\ngtitle{\ndoctitle}     % uncomment this is compiled into chapter wrapper this directory

Make sure you uncomment the right line.
