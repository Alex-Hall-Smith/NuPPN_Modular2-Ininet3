Excercise I

- Open parameter.input file, put NNN=0
In this way, just the isotopes and the reactions listed in parameter.input will
be used for the calculations. The rection rates will be taken from the 
subroutine called vital.
The first 4 lines in parameter.input looks like

#  DZEITJ   TMAXJ   ITTD  DGRD	GRDTHRESHOLD	T9	RHO/[cgs] DZEITJMAX/yr IVIT INCR
    1.E0    5.e1    6     1.D-3 1.E-12          0.12    1.E2      1.E2         1     1 
C NVCP NRCP NNN
   36   65   0

-Open ppn.f, search for "yps(j,ispe('C  13'))".
Use this place to change initial abundance. Set as following the abundance for
He4, C12, C13 and put to zero the abundance of the other isotopes:

	yps=0.d0
	yps(j,ispe('HE  4'))=0.58882999999999996d0
	yps(j,ispe('C  12'))=0.4d0
	yps(j,ispe('C  13'))=0.01d0

- Save and compile ppn.f.
When you run the code, you obtain already a lot of useful informations, like
isotopes included and reactions as well (both are .true. if they are considered, 
.false. if not).
Read them carefully for all the next excercises.


- useful output files:

i) debugnetwork.txt: informations for network debug
I recommend to enter in the code now and look why this informations are printed.
e.g.

    NUMBER of considered isotopes and reactions:           34  and           49
 selected            0  isotopes and            0  reactions from 
  networkI subroutine           0          65

It means that 34 isotopes and 49 reactions are selected, but 0 isotopes and 0
reactions from subroutine networkI (we set NNN=0) 

ii) selem.dat: initial isotopic abundances and abundances evolution, with other
informations like neutron density, alpha density and proton density, for
different evolution time steps.

iii) x-time.dat: at different times (column 1) log_10(C13) is given (column 3).
You can enter in the code and modify the printing set up in you want to print 
other isotopes.

 

Excercise II

-Open ppn.f, search for "yps(j,ispe('C  13'))".
Set the initial abundances to

	yps=0.d0
	yps(j,ispe('HE  4'))=0.58882999999999996d0
	yps(j,ispe('C  12'))=0.4d0
	yps(j,ispe('C  13'))=0.01d0
	yps(j,ispe('FE 56'))=1.17d-3

- Save, compile and run ppn.f.

When you run the code, you obtain also the following message

 WARNING: ISPE: NAME FE 56could not be found in ZIS
  WARNING in checknw: at input  has abundance   1.170000000000000E-003 
  in at least one mass shell but it is defined F .  will be set to zero
  and the abundance distribution will be normalized

So, with respect to excercise 1 you will not obtain differences.
The reason is that Fe56 is not included in the network listed in
parameter.input.
You must enlarge the network, to include also Fe56.


Excercise III

- Open parameter.input file, put NNN=500
In this way, you add 500 isotopes and relative reactions from subroutine 
networkI. This does not mean that the final number of isotope must be 500! 
If in parameter.input there are isotopes not present in the networkI libraries
and they are set to .true., they will be added.

- Run ppn.f.
  
Neutron captures and beta decys are working for heavy isotopes, including new
500 isotopes from networkI!
Check in selem.dat the evolution of the abundances.

Excercise IV

- Open parameter.input file, put NNN=1080 (up to Bi isotopes).
Set TMAXJ to 5.e2. TMAXJ is the number of years that the code will calculate the
nucleosynthesis.

- Run ppn.f. 

Neutron captures and beta decys are working for heavy isotopes, including new
500 isotopes from networkI!
Check in selem.dat the evolution of the abundances.
Redo the same exercise using different TMAXJ. You will see that according to the
amount of burned C13 (and of the total neutron exposure) the heavy isotopes 
distribution will change.

Excercise V

Now, in parameter.input put the temperature T9 to 0.30.

The first 4 lines in parameter.input looks like
#  DZEITJ   TMAXJ   ITTD  DGRD	GRDTHRESHOLD	T9	RHO/[cgs] DZEITJMAX/yr IVIT INCR
    1.E0    5.e0    6     1.D-3 1.E-12          0.30    1.E2      1.E2         1     0 
C NVCP NRCP NNN
   36   65   1080

Run ppn.f.

You will obtain

stop: no convergence

The code does not converge in 6 iteractions (ITTD 6, given in parameter.input).
The nucleosynthesis flows are too strong, and the time step (DZEITJ 1.E0) of 1
yr is too high.



Excercise VI

Now, in parameter.input put the time step DZEITJ = 1.E-5 and the maximum numper
of time steps per year DZEITJMAX/yr = 1.E5.

The first 4 lines in parameter.input looks like
#  DZEITJ   TMAXJ   ITTD  DGRD	GRDTHRESHOLD	T9	RHO/[cgs] DZEITJMAX/yr IVIT INCR
    1.E-5    5.e0    6     1.D-3 1.E-12          0.30    1.E2      1.E5         1     0 
C NVCP NRCP NNN
   36   65   1080

Run ppn.f.


Now, you find a solution.
DZEITJ = 1.E-5 means a time step of about 5 hours.
If you open the file selem.dat and you check the neutron density, 
it is 1.67E+015 n*cm^-3!

I recommend to play with DZEITJ, and check if reducing or increasing a little
bit the time step, the solution changes.
