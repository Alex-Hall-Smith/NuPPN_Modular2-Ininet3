Bibliographic index

For most reactions, different rates are proposed. These can be selected with the 'bibliographic index' field, according to the following rules:

    * for reactions from NACRE:
          o 1 = NACRE nominal rate
          o 2 = NACRE lower limit
          o 3 = NACRE upper limit

          o 10 = Hauser-Feshbach (if Z >= 8)
          o 11 = most recent rate in use before NACRE (generally CF88, as listed here)
          o 12 = second most recent rate in use before NACRE
          o 13 = etc..

          o 100 = forces the use of Iliadis et al. table of proton-capture rates on 20 < A < 40 nuclei (2001, ApJS 134, 151), when available

          o 401 = forces the use of nominal value...
          o 402 = forces the use of lower value...
          o 403 = forces the use of upper value...
            ...from Descouvemont et al. compilation of Big Bang nucleosynthesis reaction rates (2004, Atomic Data Nuclear Data Tables 88, 203) 
    * for reactions not in NACRE:
          o 1 = most recent rate [usually Iliadis et al. 2001 for proton-capture reactions, or Descouvemont et al. (2004)]

          o 10 = Hauser-Feshbach (if A > 8)
          o 11 = most recent rate before Iliadis et al. (usually CF88, as listed here)
          o 12 = second most recent rate etc.. (as listed here)

          o 100 = forces the use of Iliadis et al. rate when available

          o 200 = forces the use of Bao et al. table of radiative neutron-capture rates (2000, Atomic Data and Nucl. Data Tables 75, 1)

          o 401 = forces the use of nominal value...
          o 402 = forces the use of lower value...
          o 403 = forces the use of upper value...
            ...from Descouvemont et al. compilation of Big Bang nucleosynthesis reaction rates (2004, Atomic Data Nuclear Data Tables 88, 203) 
    * for weak-interaction rates:
          o 1 = nominal rate from Goriely (1999, Astron. Astrophys. 342, 881; Table available in electronic form), updating Takahashi & Yokoi (1987, Atomic Data Nucl. Data Tables 36, 375) table
          o 2 = low rate from Goriely (1999)
          o 3 = high rate from Goriely (1999)

          o 4 = forces the use of Takahashi & Yokoi (1987, Atomic Data Nucl. Data Tables 36, 375) table

          o 300 = forces the use of Langanke & Martinez (2000, Nucl.Phys. A 673, 481) table
          o 301 = forces the use of Oda et al. (1994, Atomic Data and Nuclear Data Tables 56, 231) table
