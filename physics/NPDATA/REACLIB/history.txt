2000:
   This is a limited update of a previous version. The previous version
   was the 1991 version of reaclib, updated to z=46 in 1995 by
   Ch. Freiburghaus and T. Rauscher. It can be found online at
   http://ie.lbl.gov/astro/friedel.html . In this update, the
   theoretical NON-SMOKER rates were inserted and replaced previous
   theoretical values. The NON-SMOKER rates include targets up to z=83.
   As mass formula, the FRDM was chosen.
   For the partition functions, the partition functions published in
   ADNDT 75 (2000) 1 were included in winvn. For partition functions not
   included in that paper, the values from the previous version were kept.
