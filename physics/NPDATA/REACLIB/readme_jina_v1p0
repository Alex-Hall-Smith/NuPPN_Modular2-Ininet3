for file winvne_v1.0_modified.dat versus winvne_v1.0.dat
- the following species and partition function are added:

- N24
- O12,O27,O29,O31,O32,O33,O34
- F32,F33,F34,F35,F36,f38
- rb65
- sr67
- y69
- zr71
- nb73
- mo75,mo76
- tc77,tc78
- ru79,ru80
- rh81,rh82
- pd83,pd84,pd85
- ag85,ag86,ag87
- cd87,cd88,cd89
- in89,in90,in91
- sn91,sn92,sn93
- po277,po278,po279
- at280,at281,at282

not included in winvne_v1.0.dat.
According to T. Rauscher, private communication, odd-even effect in partition functions in considered.
Therefore, e.g. partition function of N24 is taken from N22. Partition function of O27 is taken from O25.
Richard suggested instead to set partition function to 1.0 for these extra isotopes.

Notice also that I add the al-6 and al*6 specie in winvne file, because in the way I am reading in the data, 
I need to have consistent network between winvne and the main reaclib file.
