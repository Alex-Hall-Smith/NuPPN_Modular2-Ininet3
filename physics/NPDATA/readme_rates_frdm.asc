This data set of seven files contains input data previously used to
calculate the astrophysical reaction rate fits published in T. Rauscher
and F.-K. Thielemann, ADNDT 75, 1 (2000). The files give the calculated 
reaction cross sections for the ground state, the calculated reaction rates
for deriving the previously published fits, and the experimental nuclear level
information used in the calculation. Detailed explanation of the contents of
the files can be found below.

A. Cross Section Files

cs_frdm.asc:
                Nuclear cross sections for the ground state calculated
                with input data from the Finite Range Droplet Model (FRDM).

cs_etfsiq.asc:
                Nuclear cross sections for the ground state calculated
                with input data from the Extended Thomas-Fermi Approach with
		Strutinski Integral (ETFSI-Q) mass model.

General format of the above cross section files:

        The data blocks are sorted first by target nucleus (charge, mass
        number) and then by projectile. For each target-projectile
	combination, the capture cross sections are printed for all calculated
	energies. In addition, the cross sections are given for those
        particle-particle reaction channels with Q>=0. Thus, each data block
	will have a different number of lines, depending on the number of
	calculated energies and exoergic reaction channels. The lines are
	organized as follows:
        a) The first line, the identification line gives: charge of target (Z);
	   mass number of target (A); projectile (p=0 for neutron, 1 for proton,
	   2 for alpha particle); number L of calculated energies; particle
	   exit channel one (b=0: values are not tabulated, b=1: values are
	   tabulated); particle exit channel two (c=0 or 1, as for b above); 
	   charge of compound nucleus (Zc); mass number of compound nucleus 
	   (Ac); separation energies SN for neutron, SP for proton, and SA for
	   alpha particle of the compound nucleus (in MeV); then again the 
	   target written in isotopic notation, the projectile, and the order 
	   of the final channels starting with capture.
        b) Following the first line are the L energies in MeV at which cross
           sections were calculated. There are at most eight values per line.
        c) L capture cross sections (in barn); with a maximum of eight values
	   per line.
        d) If b+c>0 there are L*(b+c) cross sections given for the final
	   channels. If b=0 but c>0, then only values for the second exit
	   channel ((n,a), (p,a) or (a,p)) are given.
        A new data block starts with an identification line after the last
        cross section line.

	Each file is concluded by a line stating END OF TABLE.


cs_frdm_endo.asc,
cs_etfsiq_endo.asc:
		Nuclear cross sections calculated with FRDM and ETFSIQ-Q input,
		respectively, of endothermic reactions with particles in the
		exit channel and Q<0.

	The structure of the file is the same as for the cross
	section files described above with the following exceptions:
	a) There are no cross sections listed for the capture channel.
	b) Only cross sections for reactions with Q<0 are listed.
	c) Only energies are listed for which at least one of the
	   cross sections of the exit channels is not negligibly
	   small (<= 10^(-30) barn); the cross sections can be assumed
	   to be zero below the lowest given energy.

	Each file is concluded by a line stating END OF TABLE.



B. Rate Files

rates_frdm.asc:
		Astrophysical reaction rates in tabular form, computed with the 
		cross sections from cs_frdm.asc for laboratory rates. 
		Also given are the stellar rates for thermally excited targets.

rates_etfsiq.asc:
		Astrophysical reaction rates in tabular form, computed with the 
		cross sections from cs_etfsiq.asc for laboratory rates. 
		Also given are the stellar rates for thermally excited targets.


General format of the reaction rate files:

        The rates have been calculated at 24 temperatures T_9(=10^9 K)=
	0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 
	0.8,  0.9, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 
	4.0,  4.5, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0.
	The entries are sorted first by target nucleus (charge, mass number)
	and then by projectile. For each target-projectile combination the
	capture rates are always printed. Rates are also printed for those
	particle exit channels for which Q>=0. Thus, each data block will have
	a different number of total lines, depending on the number of exoergic
	particle channels. The lines are organized as follows:
           Line 1, the identification line gives: charge of target (Z); mass
		number of target (A); projectile (p=0 for neutron, 1 for proton,
		2 for alpha particle); particle exit channel one (b=0: values
		are not tabulated, b=1: values are tabulated); particle exit 
		channel two (c=0 or 1, as for b above); then again the target 
		written in isotopic notation, the projectile and the order of 
		the final channels starting with capture.
	   Lines 2-4: Astrophysical reaction rates N_A<sigma v>^lab for capture
		in cm^3 s^-1 mol^-1 at the 24 temperatures with eight entries 
		per line. Note that these are LABORATORY RATES, computed with 
		sigma^lab, i.e. with the target being in the ground state, 
		as would be measured in the laboratory (as opposed to the 
		stellar environment).
	   Line 5: Blank line.
	   Lines 6-8: Same as lines 2-4 but this time the STELLAR RATES for
		capture are given, for a thermally excited target in a stellar 
		plasma. Only these rates should be used to derive a reverse 
		reaction rate by detailed balance. See the ADNDT paper for more
		details.
	   (Lines 9-21): If b+c>0 there are 2*24*(b+c) rates given for the
		particle exit channels. If b=0 but c>0, then only values for
		the second final channel ((n,a), (p,a) or (a,p)) are given.
		For each channel, first the laboratory rates and then the
		stellar rates are printed. There is a blank line after each
		set of rates at the 24 temperatures except for the last set.
        A new data block starts with an identification line directly following
	the last line of stellar reaction rates.

	Each file is concluded by a line stating END OF TABLE.



C. Nuclear Level Information

levels.asc:
		Experimental level and spin and parity information which has
		been used in the statistical model calculations. Up to 20
		experimental levels were used. Only those levels are
		listed for which a definite spin and parity assignment was
		available, up to the first level for which the spin/parity 
		assignment was not known. Given here are only isotopes for 
		which at least the ground state is known experimentally. In all
		other cases the ground state spin and parity were derived from a
		theoretical model, and a theoretical level density was
		used above the ground state. Theoretical spins are not
		listed but can be found in T. Rauscher and F.-K. Thielemann, 
		ADNDT 75, 1 (2000).

Format of levels.asc:

        The isotopes are ordered first by charge and then by mass number.

        Each identification line gives charge and mass number of the isotope,
        the number L of levels given, and the isotope written in element
	notation.

        Information for L levels then follows. For each level the excitation
	energy is given in MeV, together with the parity and the spin 
	assignments. The parity is coded as a sign before the spin. There are
	at most five levels per line.

        A new data block starts with an identification line behind the last
	line of levels.

	The file is concluded by a line stating END OF TABLE.
