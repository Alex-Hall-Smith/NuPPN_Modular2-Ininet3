NOTE # 1 (AUG 30 2007):

tommy5d.ifort_v2.f90 (COMPILED WITH IFORT)
AND 
tommy5dg77.f (COMPILED WITH G77)
GIVE THE SAME RESULT, TESTED AT 30 KEV.
NEW FORTRAN VERSION: IA32/INTEL64, FORTRAN2003.
STARTING FROM NOW, I WILL USE INTEL COMPILER TO GO AHEAD INSTEAD OF G77
(BASIS VERSION: TOMMY5D).
*******************************************************
NOTE # 2 (AUG 31 2007):

- tommy5d.ifort_v3.f90
CALCULATIONS OF TOMMY'S RATES ARE MOVED TO SUBROUTINE RAUSCHER I
- tommy5d.ifort_v4.f90
CALCULATIONS OF TOMMY'S AND KADONIS RATES ARE MOVED TO SUBROUTINE RAUSCHER I
AND KADONIS I, RESPECTIVELY.

THESE VERSIONS HAVE BEEN CONTROLLED. THEY GAVE THE SAME RESULTS OF PREVIOUS VERSIONS
(SEE THE NOTE BEFORE)
*******************************************************
NOTE # 3 (SEPT 04 2007):
- tommy5d.ifort_v11.f90
THE NETWORK IS IMPLEMENTED IN ORDER TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ISTANTANEOUS DECAYS FOR
(NG),(NA),(NP) AND (GN) IN CASE THE ISOTOPE DAUGHTER IS NOT INCLUDED.
ALSO IN CASE OF SOME HOLE IN THE NETWORK (E.G. KR78,KR80..BUT KR79 IS NOT
INCLUDED) IT SHOULD BE FINE NOW. MOREOVER, IN CASE WE ARE IN THE KADONIS RANGE A
WARNING IS GIVEN IN CASE OF SOME HOLE.
- tommy5d.ifort_v12.f90
IT DOES THE SAME OF tommy5d.ifort_v11.f90, BUT A NEW SUBROUTINE IS INCLUDED
(natashamcloane..;-)) WHERE ARROWS ARE DEFINED FOR RAUSCHER TABLES DATA
(arrow01,arrow02,arrow03,arrow04).
*******************************************************
NOTE # 4 (SEPT 11 2007):
- tommy5d.ifort_v16.f90
THE NETWORK IS ENLARGED, INCLUDING ALSO PROTON CAPTURE AND (GAMMA,P)
PHOTODISINTEGRATIONS.
TAKE CARE, DO NOT LEAVE HOLES IN THE NETWORK IF YOU CAN. IN PARTICULAR IN THE
PROTON RICH PART YOU COULD DO MISTAKES. 
THE SUBROUTINE NATASHAMCLOANE IS MODIFIED WITH RESPECT TO THE PREVIOUS VERSIONS,
AND NOW IT IS BETTER! IN FACT, OLDER VERSIONS HAVE SOME PROBLEMS INCLUDING
PROTON CAPTURES (IN THE PROTON RICH SIDE OF THE NETWORK). 
NOW THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED.
*******************************************************
NOTE # 5 (SEPT 26 2007):
- tommy7b.ifort_v05.f90
PROTON CAPTURES,ALPHA CAPTURES, NEUTRON CAPTURES AND PHOTODISINTEGRATIONS ARE
INCLUDED FROM TOMMY.
BETA+,ELECTR.CAPT.,BETA- ARE INCLUDED FROM NETGEN (subroutine vitnetgenbeta)
with recommended file by netgen creator v6.1. NOTE THAT FULLER&FOWLER1985 ARE
NOT INCLUDED FOR LIGHT ISOTOPES!!
SUBROUTINE LINEARLY INTERPOLATES FOR DENSITY DEPENDENT RATE (NOT CLEAR YET WHAT
IT DOES TO INTERPOLATE FOR TEMPERATURE...). THIS IS WRONG,
CONSIDERING THAT DATA ARE GIVEN WITHIN A WIDE SPREAD FOR DENSITY.  
LOGARITMIC INTERPOLATION MUST BE DONE! FUTURE CHANGE TO DO.
PROTON CAPTURES ARE INCLUDED FROM NACRE (LOW,REC,UP, YOU MAY CHOOSE..) 
AS NETGEN TABLE AS WELL (subroutine vitnetgennacre). 
- tommy7b.ifort_v06.f90
THE SAME AS *_v05*, BUT ALSO ALPHA CAPTURES FROM NACRE (LOW,REC,UP, 
YOU MAY CHOOSE..) AS NETGEN TABLE ARE INCLUDED.
*********************************************************
NOTE # 6 (OCT 4 2007):
- tommy7b.ifort_v10.f
I CHANGE FILE.F90 IN FILE.F, READABLE ALSO WITH OLD FASHION STYLES (E.G. G77).
THERE IS ONE NETGEN SUBROUTINE FOR EVERYTHING (subroutine vitnetgen).
FOR BETA DECAYS IN NETGEN AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES, INSTEAD OF ZERO OR NaN 
NOW THERE IS THE OPTION THAT  THE PROGRAM TAKES THE LAST VALUE DIFFERENT FROM
ZERO OR NaN. BUT, IT IS BETTER THIS OR A LOG INTERPOLATION FROM THE TEMPERATURE
RANGE AVAILABLE? ....(Franz said: 'umhh...could be dangerous....').
I THINK THAT THE LOG EXTRAPOLATION FROM THE TEMPERATURE
RANGE AVAILABLE SHOULD BE FINE CLOSE TO THE RANGE AVAILABLE, BUT FAR AWAY NO.
SO, FOR NOW, I THINK IT IS BETTER TO TAKE THE LAST AVAILABLE VALUE IN THE RANGE. 
.......
NOW, IT IS TIME TO INCLUDE SUBROUTINE IN THE MAIN CODE.....
