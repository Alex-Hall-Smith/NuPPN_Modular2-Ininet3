## About

This directory contains a Fortran 90 interface to the superLU sparse matrix
solver, which is written in C. The Fortran interface provided by superLU do not
support sparse matrices in compressed row format, which is what the Intel MKL
Direct Sparse Solver routines need. Rather than write the sparse matrix in
different formats inside PPN/solver, Philipp Edelmann wrote this nice interface
to superLU so that we can pass it *either* a row-compressed (irow=1) *or* a
column compressed (irow=0) sparse matrix. Thanks, Philipp! Be aware, however,
that the superLU routines eventually will convert the compressed row matrix
back into a compressed column matrix again before the solve, which sucks a
little bit.
